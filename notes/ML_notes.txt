* Represent as regression problem w/ supervised solution (predict move probability)
* Using Random forest to accomplish


Random Forest Model
features to implement:
     delta material attacked,

features already implemented:
    stockfish rating delta, material captured, material sacrifice, is sacrifice, is capturable, is check, delta activity, delta piece activity
    capture opportunity cost, eval opporunity cost
    ispromotion

    -the max values will require probabilities to be evaluated in batches, not individually 
    
    potentially more if they come to mind.


Run PCA to determine which to use
